Hi Jeff, Seth,

I have uploaded the following results:
A. DiffBind results after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets from 2017 (WT and Q111het) and 2020 (WT and QQ) using Broad Peak strategy
    https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/07_WT_Q111_QQ_data_analysis/DiffBind_results
    
    This contains the unfiltered and filtered diffbind results for
    1. 2017 (Q111 vs WT)
    2. 2020 (QQ vs WT)

B. Enrichment results after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets from 2017 (WT and Q111het) and 2020 (WT and QQ) using Broad Peak strategy for DiffBind results comparing QQ vs WT in the 2020 dataset
    https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/08_enrichment_analysis/WT_Q111_QQ_DiffBind
    
    This contains the enrichment analysis using the significant differentially bound peaks from 2020 (QQ vs WT) comparison
    1. GAT enrichment against multiple reference genomic sets
    2. Geneset enrichment against the LangFelder Genesets and other ChIPEnrich supported genesets

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments.

Regards,
