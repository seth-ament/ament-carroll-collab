Enrichment Analyses of:
1. Analytical results after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets from 2017 (WT and Q111het) and 2020 (WT and QQ) using Broad Peak strategy
2. Analytical results after re-analyzing ActiveMotif ChIP-Seq datasets for EZH2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27Ac

against several reference chromatin sets, other datasets, and genesets

Hi Jeff, Seth,

I have uploaded all of the previously delivered GAT and ChIP Enrichment results to:
https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/08_enrichment_analysis

Additionally I have added the ‘Gene-centric DiffBind Results’ to the above directory which include the differential binding results within promoter regions of genes.
    The differentially binding analyses was done using the Htt_ChIPSeq_Peaks based on ‘any_2_samples’ and ‘any_3_samples’ criteria
    The differentially binding analyses was also done using the Active Motif Histone Mark Peak regions

If a specific gene doesn’t show up then no overlapping peaks were found in the promoter region of the gene.

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments at our meeting today.

Lastly, I will be off for the last 3 weeks of the year and was told that I would be provided some resources to fill-in in my absence. But that didn’t happen so further analyses may be postponed till the new year.
    If there are smaller details that you may need while we start to rewrite the manuscript, let me know and I will try and send those over.

Regards,
Amol
