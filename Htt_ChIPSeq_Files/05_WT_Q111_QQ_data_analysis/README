Hi Jeff, Seth,

Find attached the following:

https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/05_WT_Q111_QQ_data_analysis

1. Slides including latest diffbind analyses (with separate PDFs for diffbind plots)
    A. Slides include diffbind analysis for B2017 and B2020 analyzed together —> distortion due to batch differences
    B. Slides include diffbind analysis for B2017 and B2020 analyzed separately for the common set of 57k peak regions
    C. Slides include diffbind meta-analysis using results individual results from (B)
2. Excel Spreadsheet with results before and after meta-analysis
3. Plots illustrating diffbind results from 1A and 1B (that couldn’t be added to the the Slides

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments.

Regards,
Amol
