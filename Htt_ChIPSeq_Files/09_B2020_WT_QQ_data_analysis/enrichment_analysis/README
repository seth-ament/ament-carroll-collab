Enrichment results after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets from 2020 (WT and QQ)
1. Downstreamed to 30M reads
2. Broad Peak calling
3. Merged Peaks (peaks found in any 2 samples)
4. Peaks specific or shared between genotypes (WT-specific, QQ-specific, WT-QQ-Shared)
5. Peaks enriched in each genotype based on diffbind results (WT-enriched, QQ-enriched)
