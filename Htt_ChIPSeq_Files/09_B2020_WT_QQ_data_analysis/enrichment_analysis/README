Enrichment results after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets from 2020 (WT and QQ)
1. Downstreamed to 30M reads
2. Broad Peak calling
3. Merged Peaks (peaks found in any 2 samples)
4. Peaks specific or shared between genotypes (WT-specific, QQ-specific, WT-QQ-Shared)
5. Peaks enriched in each genotype based on diffbind results (WT-enriched, QQ-enriched)

Hi Jeff, Seth,

I have uploaded all of the results from latest iteration of analyses based on the WT and QQ samples from B2020 to:
https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/09_B2020_WT_QQ_data_analysis

These include:
  1. Individual peak calls for each sample
  2. Merged peak calls across samples
  3. Unfiltered and filtered differential binding results for B2020 (QQ vs WT)
  4. GAT enrichment against multiple reference genomic sets
  5. Geneset enrichment against the LangFelder Genesets and other ChIPEnrich supported genesets

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments. Have a great weekend!

Regards,
Amol
