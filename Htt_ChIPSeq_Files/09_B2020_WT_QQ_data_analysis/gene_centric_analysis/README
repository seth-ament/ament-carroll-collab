Gene Centric DiffBind Analyses of:
1. Analytical results of promoter occupancy after analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets 2020 (WT and QQ) using Broad Peak strategy
2. Analytical results of promoter occupancy after re-analyzing ActiveMotif ChIP-Seq datasets for EZH2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27Ac

Hi Jeff, Seth,

I have uploaded the results from the latest iteration of gene-centric and integrated -omics analyses to:
https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/09_B2020_WT_QQ_data_analysis/integrated_omics

These include:
  1. Gene-centric diffbind results based on promoter occupancy of HTT ChIPSeq from the WT and QQ samples from B2020
  2. Gene-centric diffbind results based on promoter occupancy of ActiveMotif Histone ChIPSeq for EZH2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27Ac
  3. Integration of analytical results for the above diffbind results based on promoter occupancy in RNASeq DEGs from the Langfelder et. al. publication
        This includes the new illustrations for Figure 5 of the manuscript comparing diffbind LFC from HTT ChIPSeq to each of the 5 ActiveMotif Histone ChIPSeq

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments. Have a great week!

Regards,
Amol
