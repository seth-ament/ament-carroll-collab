1. Slides from todayâ€™s meeting (with separate PDFs for version-specific plots
2. List of peaks from Version 3 with annotation
3. Differentially bound peak regions for the following comparison
    1. 2020 WT vs 2017 WT
    2. 2017 mHTT vs 2017 WT
    3. 2020 mHTT vs 2020 WT
    4. 2020 mHTT vs 2017 mHTT
    5. mHTT vs WT after batch correction

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments.
