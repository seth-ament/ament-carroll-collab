Hi Jeff, Seth,

Find attached the following:

https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/06_ActiveMotif_Histone_Marks

1. Slides illustrating results for the ActiveMotif Histone Mark Datasets
2. List of peaks with annotation
3. Differentially bound peak regions between Q111 and WT for each of the EZH2 and Histone Mark datasets
4. Figure illustrating all 4 histone marks in one plot

Additionally, I am attaching the first enrichment results of Chromatin States for the following peaksets of Htt ChIPseq:
  A. Original analysis of only B2020 QQ and WT samples
    1. Htt_WT_QQ.samples.diffbind_v20210329.B2020_mHTTvsWT.WT-enriched
    2. Htt_WT_QQ.samples.diffbind_v20210329.B2020_mHTTvsWT.QQ-enriched
  
  B. Latest analysis of 57k peaks for B2017 and B2020 samples
    3. Htt_ChIPSeq.diffbind_v20210831.B2017_mHTTvsWT.WT-enriched
    4. Htt_ChIPSeq.diffbind_v20210831.B2017_mHTTvsWT.mHTT-enriched
    5. Htt_ChIPSeq.diffbind_v20210831.B2020_mHTTvsWT.WT-enriched
    6. Htt_ChIPSeq.diffbind_v20210831.B2020_mHTTvsWT.mHTT-enriched
  
  C. Reproducibility groups based on B2017 and B2020 samples
    7. Htt_ChIPSeq.reproducibility_groups.WT-specific
    8. Htt_ChIPSeq.reproducibility_groups.WT-mHTT-shared
    9. Htt_ChIPSeq.reproducibility_groups.mHTT-specific

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments.

Regards,
Amol
