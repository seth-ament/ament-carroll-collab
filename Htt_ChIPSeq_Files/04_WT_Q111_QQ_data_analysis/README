Hi Jeff, Seth,

Find attached the following:

https://github.com/seth-ament/ament-carroll-collab/tree/master/Htt_ChIPSeq_Files/04_WT_Q111_QQ_data_analysis

1. Slides including latest analyses (with separate PDFs for version-specific plots)
        I modified the reproducibility categories to hopefully simplify them
        Regenerated the diffBind analyses using
            1. edgeR correction (2 Batches and 2 conditions)
            2. ComBat correction (2 Batches and 2 conditions)
            3. ComBat correction (2 Batches and 3 genotypes)
2. List of peaks from Version 3 with annotation
3. Differentially bound peak regions for the following comparison
    1. mHTT vs WT after batch correction using edgeR model
    2. mHTT vs WT after batch correction using ComBat-Seq
    3. Qhet vs WT after batch correction using ComBat-Seq
    4. mHTT (a.k.a QQ) vs WT after batch correction using ComBat-Seq
    5. mHTT (a.k.a QQ) vs Qhet after batch correction using ComBat-Seq

Looking forward to your thoughts and comments.

Regards,
Amol
